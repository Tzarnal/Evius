A FEN record contains six fields, each separated by a space. The fields are as follows:[5]

    Piece placement data: Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1, with a "/" between each one; within each rank, the contents of the squares are described in order from the a-file to the h-file. 
    Each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names in algebraic notation (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K"). 
    White pieces are designated using uppercase letters ("PNBRQK"), while black pieces use lowercase letters ("pnbrqk"). 
    A set of one or more consecutive empty squares within a rank is denoted by a digit from "1" to "8", corresponding to the number of squares.
    
    
    Active color: "w" means that White is to move; "b" means that Black is to move.
    
    
    Castling availability: If neither side has the ability to castle, this field uses the character "-". Otherwise, this field contains one or more letters: 
        "K" if White can castle kingside, "Q" if White can castle queenside, "k" if Black can castle kingside, and "q" if Black can castle queenside. 
        A situation that temporarily prevents castling does not prevent the use of this notation.
    
    
    En passant target square: This is a square over which a pawn has just passed while moving two squares; it is given in algebraic notation. 
    If there is no en passant target square, this field uses the character "-". This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to capture en passant.
    [6] An updated version of the spec has since made it so the target square is recorded only if a legal en passant capture is possible, but the old version of the standard is the one most commonly used.[7][8]
    
    
    Halfmove clock: The number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance, used for the fifty-move rule.[9]
    
    
    Fullmove number: The number of the full moves. It starts at 1 and is incremented after Black's move.



The following example is from the FEN specification:[10]

    Here is the FEN for the starting position:

        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

    And after the move 1.e4:

        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1

    And then after 1...c5:

        rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2

    And then after 2.Nf3:

        rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2
